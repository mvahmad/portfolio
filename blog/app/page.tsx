        {`I’m Ahmad Movahedi, a web developer with over 2 years of experience in online brand promotion and digital presence optimization. My background in branding has given me a strong understanding of how design, strategy, and technology work together to create meaningful user experiences.

Currently, I specialize in developing modern, responsive, and high-performance web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js. I enjoy translating ideas into clean, efficient, and visually engaging web interfaces that help businesses strengthen their online identity.

I’m passionate about writing maintainable code, optimizing performance, and continuously improving my technical skills within the React ecosystem.

My goal is to collaborate on impactful projects that combine creativity with functionality — building digital products that not only look great but deliver real results.`}
